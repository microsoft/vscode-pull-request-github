## 0.70.0

### Changes

- The "Create" view has been updated to be less noisy and more useful. Aside from the purely visual changes, the following features have been added:
  - We try to guess the best possible base branch for your PR instead of always using the default branch.
  - You can add reviewers, assignees, labels, and milestones to your PR from the "Create" view.
  - By default, your last "create option" will be remembered (ex. draft or auto merge)
  - The view is much faster.
  - You can view diffs before publishing your branch.
  - Once the branch is published, you can also view commits (this is coming soon for unpublished branches).

  ![The new create view](/documentation/changelog/0.70.0/new-create-view.png)

- If you work on a fork of a repository, but don't ever want to know about or make PRs to the parent, you can prevent the `upstream` remote from being added with the new setting `"githubPullRequests.upstreamRemote": "never"`.

### Fixes

- Quote reply missing for some comments. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/issues/5012
- Accessibility of "suggest edits" new workflow and documentation. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/issues/4946

- Editor tab titles are now shortened to the file name when viewing diffs from a pull request, and are suffixed with `(Pull Request)`.

## 0.20.1

- Fixes loading the extension in VSCode Insider's 1.50

## 0.20.0

### Changes

- Pull requests and issues now follows a multi-repo model. This means that if you have folders in your workspace from different repositories you'll see the issues and pull requests from the repositories at the same time. You can also have pull requests checked out from multiple repositories.

![Multi-repo](documentation/changelog/0.20.0/multirepo.png)

- There is new setting, `githubPullRequests.pullRequestDescription`, to control how the description is set when creating a pull request. By default, this uses the pull request template in the repository if it exists, but can also be changed to use the latest commit message, a custom message input at create time, or to ask which of these options to use. Thank you to @heaths for this feature!

### Notable fixes

- GitHub Action based status checks are now rendered on the description page.
- Commenting on stale pull requests is better handled.

## 0.19.0

### Changes

- When you try to **Start Working on Issue** in a repository where you don't have permission to push, you now have the option to fork the repository. This flow will fork the repository and configure your remotes.

![Offer Fork](documentation/changelog/0.19.0/offer-fork.png)

- When attempting to push changes to a repository that you do not have permissions to push to, the extension will now prompt you to fork the repository and push to that instead.

![Automatic fork repository](documentation/changelog/0.19.0/fork-github.gif)

- Updated the version of @octokit/rest to ^18.0.0. This is was a big refactor, but should result in better performance.

### Notable fixes

- The setting `githubIssues.workingIssueBranch` is deprecated in favor of the better named `githubIssues.issueBranchTitle`.
- The `githubIssues.issueBranchTitle` setting is now validated.

## 0.18.1

### Changes

## 0.18.0

### Changes

- The Issues view now shows the markdown card on hover.

![Tree Hover](documentation/changelog/0.18.0/tree-hover.gif)

- Label suggestions are provided in the new issue editor.

![Label Suggestion](documentation/changelog/0.18.0/label-suggestion.gif)

- Hovers work for issues formatted as GH-123.
- The `githubIssues.issueBranchTitle` setting can take the new variable `${sanitizedIssueTitle}`.
- If you have uncommitted changes in your issue branch when you try to create a pull request, you'll be prompted to commit them.

![Commit Prompt](documentation/changelog/0.18.0/commit-prompt.png)

- Closed issues in the Issues view use the closed icon.
- The Pull Requests and Issues views use the visually appealing welcome mechanism to display the Sign in button.

![Welcome View](documentation/changelog/0.18.0/welcome-view.png)

### Notable fixes

- Users are only fetched when needed, not on every startup ([1869](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/issues/1869))
- For hovers, the max issue number for the repo is checked to reduce false positives([1860](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/issues/1860))

## 0.17.0

### Changes

- Improved display of labels in issue hovers by swapping out the existing svg version of the labels for a newly supported html version.

![Markdown labels](documentation/changelog/0.17.0/markdown-label.png)

- When creating a GitHub permalink, we now try to pick the "best" remote if the currently opened repository has several remotes. The priority of remote is `upstream`, `ups`, `origin`, then other names. The first remote from that ordering which contains the same commit that the current branch is on will be used in the permalink.
- Issue creation now better takes into account the file that you're coming from when you create an issue instead of only listening for repository change when a different repository is selected in the SCM view.
- The new issue editor now lets you edit the title, assignees, labels, and description.

![New issue editor](documentation/changelog/0.17.0/new-issue-editor.gif)

- User and issue completions now only show in plaintext and in comments! No more noisy issue suggestions when you trigger suggest in code.

### Notable fixes

- Issues shown in the completion suggestion are now deduped, even when the `githubIssues.queries` result in having the same issue twice ([1800](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/issues/1800)).

As part of this release, we have begun adopting GitHub's GraphQL API in some places to support new features and improve performance. The reviews feature and linkifying of issue references depend on the GraphQL API. This API is not available for GitHub Enterprise, so please note that these features will not be available for those projects.

**New settings**

- `githubPullRequests.remotes` can be used to configure what remotes pull requests should be displayed from. By default, the extension will look for `upstream` and `origin` remotes
  by convention and fetch from these, or will fetch from any other remotes if these are not present.
- `githubPullRequests.defaultMergeMethod` specifies which merge method (`merge`, `rebase`, or `squash`) to select by default, both on the description page and when using the `Merge Pull Request` command.
  This is set to `merge` by default.
