![Multi-repo](documentation/changelog/0.20.0/multirepo.png)

- There is new setting, `githubPullRequests.pullRequestDescription`, to control how the description is set when creating a pull request. By default, this uses the pull request template in the repository if it exists, but can also be changed to use the latest commit message, a custom message input at create time, or to ask which of these options to use. Thank you to @heaths for this feature!

### Notable fixes

![Markdown labels](documentation/changelog/0.17.0/markdown-label.png)

- When creating a GitHub permalink, we now try to pick the "best" remote if the currently opened repository has several remotes. The priority of remote is `upstream`, `ups`, `origin`, then other names. The first remote from that ordering which contains the same commit that the current branch is on will be used in the permalink.
- Issue creation now better takes into account the file that you're coming from when you create an issue instead of only listening for repository change when a different repository is selected in the SCM view.
- The new issue editor now lets you edit the title, assignees, labels, and description.

![New issue editor](documentation/changelog/0.17.0/new-issue-editor.gif)

- User and issue completions now only show in plaintext and in comments! No more noisy issue suggestions when you trigger suggest in code.

### Notable fixes

- Autocompletions for usernames within editor comments [#842](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/pull/842)

As part of this release, we have begun adopting GitHub's GraphQL API in some places to support new features and improve performance. The reviews feature and linkifying of issue references depend on the GraphQL API. This API is not available for GitHub Enterprise, so please note that these features will not be available for those projects.

**New settings**

- `githubPullRequests.remotes` can be used to configure what remotes pull requests should be displayed from. By default, the extension will look for `upstream` and `origin` remotes
  by convention and fetch from these, or will fetch from any other remotes if these are not present.
- `githubPullRequests.defaultMergeMethod` specifies which merge method (`merge`, `rebase`, or `squash`) to select by default, both on the description page and when using the `Merge Pull Request` command.
  This is set to `merge` by default.
