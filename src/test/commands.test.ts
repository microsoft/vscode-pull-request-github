// This file was created to test the handleUncommittedChanges functionality,
// but the tests were removed as they only tested mocking capabilities
// rather than meaningful functionality.
//
// The handleUncommittedChanges function is tested through manual testing
// as documented in TESTING.md, since it primarily involves user interactions
// with modal dialogs and git operations that are better tested in integration.
