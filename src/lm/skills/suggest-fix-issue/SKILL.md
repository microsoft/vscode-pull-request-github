This can be particularly useful for developers looking for guidance on how to address a problem or for those who may be new to troubleshooting issues.

## How to suggest a fix

- Carefully read through the issue's description and comments to understand the problem fully.
- Where possible output code-blocks and reference real files in the workspace with the fix.
- If the issue is related to a bug, try to identify the root cause and suggest a fix that addresses it directly.
